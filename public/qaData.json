        "ans": "React create a virtual DOM. Virtual DOM is not as original dom. In React, whenever a component state changes, the changes are reflected in Virtual DOM. Thus, Virtual DOM has the updated state of the component. React compare the updated dom with the virtual dom and update only the changes part of the node."

        "ans": "Props : Props are use to pass data from one component to another component. Props can't change. Props always return an object. State : State can change. State only excess from specific component. It means state is local in component. For every state change the component will render again."
